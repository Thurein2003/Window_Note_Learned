CPU = Central Processing Unit
MCC = memory controller chip
RAM = Random access memory
ZIF = Zero Insertion Force
SIMM = Single Inline Memory Module


1 address line ---- 2 bytes
2 address line ---- 4 bytes


CPU * FSB = Speed ratio

--> Capable of storing more computational values, including memory address.
--> 2^32 (32-bit) an 2^64(64-bit)

|Parallel execution|
1. Fatch
2. Decode
3. Execute
4. Write

Cache
L1/L2/L3

L1 = smallest an fastest
L2 = run half the speed of CPU
L3 = Biggest an dslowest cache

Read = [Selecting and installing CPU]
______________________________________

[RAM]
DIMM = SD RAM --> DDR 1 to 4

Latency = delay in RAM response time.
CAS = column array strobe

[Mother Board/Form Factor]
AT = advance technology
ATX = advance technology Extended
PCI = Peripheral Component Interconnect
POST = Power On Self Test

--PCI-> VGA(15pins)

Extension Vs Expansion

[Power Supplies]
Pressure = Voltage(V)
Volume Flowing = amperes(A)
Work = wattage(W)
Resistance = ohms(Î©)
[V = IR]
Power supplies = AC to DC
Yellow(Fan) = 13.2V
Red(data) = 5.5V
Orange = 3.6V
